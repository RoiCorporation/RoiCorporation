- 👋 Hi, I’m @RoiCorporation!
- 👀 I'm really into Arduino projects and low-level programming. When the existing libraries are not enough for me... I create my own libraries!
- 🌱 Currently studying Computer Science at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.
- 💞️ If you share a passion for hardware, sensors, libraries and you like to do cool projects, don't be afraid to reach out to me! I'm down for any cool projects!
